implementation that incorporates adaptive algorithms and intelligent
scoring mechanisms to achieve competitive routing quality in integrated
circuit design.

**System Requirements**:
- **C++**: C++14 or later with OpenMP support

- **Dependencies**: NumPy, Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

Problem to Solve
================

VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) global routing is a critical step
in the physical design of integrated circuits, responsible for
determining the routing paths for millions of interconnects while
satisfying design constraints such as capacity limits, wirelength
minimization, and timing requirements.

**Field and Industry Context**
The semiconductor industry faces increasing challenges as modern ICs
continue to scale with billions of transistors. The computational
complexity of routing algorithms has become a significant bottleneck in
the design flow, directly impacting time-to-market and design quality.

**Mathematical Foundations**
The routing problem involves:
- **Graph Theory**: Representing the routing grid as a graph with capacity
  constraints
- **Optimization Theory**: Minimizing wirelength while satisfying capacity
  constraints
- **Dynamic Programming**: Implementing efficient path-finding algorithms
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Dynamic parameter adjustment based on routing
  context

  algorithm design in academic settings

**User Workflow**
Users will interact with the router through programmatic interfaces
(C++ and Python APIs), providing input data in standard formats (e.g.,
ISPD benchmarks) and receiving optimized routing solutions with
performance metrics. The router can be integrated into existing EDA
toolchains or used as a standalone library for research and development
purposes.
